After building complex kubernetes cluster architectures for several clients, it's been a while since I planned to build a cluster for myself as a hobby project, for fun and to host projects.

Hobbies should be fun ... but requires some concession with our wives ... ðŸ˜€

I will use a Terraform workflow to configure my Kubernetes cluster.

Containers have great potential for IoT applications. Raspberry Pi based clusters could be very useful for testing and learning concepts such as microservices, application clustering, container networking and container orchestration. In this article, I've tried to cover the hardware and software configuration details to help you build your own Raspberry cluster.
